This project aims to find correlation between patients(females) that have Diabetes or not , with results of their other medical analyses.

What is Diabetes Diabetes is a condition in which the body cannot use the sugars and starches (carbohydrates) it takes in as food to make energy. The body either makes no insulin or too little insulin or cannot use the insulin it makes to change those sugars and starches into energy. As a result, extra sugar builds up in the blood.
